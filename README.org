* Live Node Server Running On Babel Transpiler

This application is my starter base for development of node web apps.
It has only the cored out essentials for doing live server reload and
live server refresh along with automatic ES6 transpilation with sourcemaps. 

** Derived from:

*** nodemon setup:

https://github.com/babel/example-node-server

*** gulp-livereload setup:

https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp

*** live-reload chrome app:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en

** Starting with Live Nodemon

** Building
